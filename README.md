# Bi-Directional Person Counter

 
# Objective
The objective of this project is to monitor number of students in a class, number of people entering / exiting a mall, automatic parking slots monitoring.
# About
A sensor will automatically detect a person walking past it and this triggers the people counter. The main intention is to design a system wherein the number of persons entering or leaving a room is displayed on a screen. When a person enters the room, count would be increased, whereas on leaving, the count would decrease.
# Features
•	Counter delivers the real-time data.
•	Display Counter Status over web-interface.
•	This circuit can be used domestically to get an indication of number of persons entering a party.
•	It can be used at official meetings.
•	It can be used at homes and other places to keep a check on the number of persons entering a secured place.
•	It can also be used as home automation system to ensure energy saving by switching on the loads and fans only when needed

# Equipment’s Required
•	2 x Laser-Diodes
•	2 x Small LDRs
•	2 x 10k ohm resistors
•	Arduino ( any microcontroller would serve the purpose )
•	9v batteries and battery connectors
•	Assortment of jumper cables
•	breadboard

# Conclusion and Future Scope
With our People Counter, we can determine the number of people within a specific area and detect their direction of movement , Our Future Scope are
•	Occupancy monitoring to control maximum or minimum occupancy, support evacuation measures and trigger demand-controlled ventilation (DCV)
•	Wrong-way detection and bi-directional counting
•	Wait time determination and queue management
•	Flow monitoring
